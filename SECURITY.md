## Fishing Net: Security Considerations

This document outlines security considerations for developing and deploying the Fishing Net API server. 


### MQL5 Terminal Communication Security

* **Authentication:** Implement a secure authentication mechanism to restrict access to MQL5 Terminal functionalities through the API. Options include:
    * **API Key:** Generate a unique API key for authorized applications.
    * **Token-based Authentication:** Implement a token-based authentication system for more granular control over access rights.
* **Authorization:** Define clear authorization levels for API endpoints to control which actions users can perform. 
* **Data Encryption:** Consider encrypting sensitive data exchanged between the Fishing Net server and the MQL5 Terminal, especially for commands with financial implications.


### Server-Side Security

* **Dependency Management:** Keep all dependencies updated to address potential vulnerabilities.
* **Input Validation:** Validate all user input thoroughly to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection).
* **Secret Management:** Store sensitive information like API keys or passwords securely using environment variables or a dedicated secret management service. 
* **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling to avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.
* **Secure Communication:** Consider using HTTPS for secure communication between the API server and clients.
* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent denial-of-service attacks.


### Development Security

* **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices to avoid common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and cross-site scripting (XSS).
* **Code Reviews:** Conduct code reviews to identify potential security issues before deployment.
* **Static Code Analysis:** Utilize static code analysis tools to detect security vulnerabilities in the codebase.


### Deployment Considerations

* **Firewall Configuration:**  Configure firewalls to restrict access to the API server from unauthorized networks.
* **User Management:**  Implement user access controls for managing API users and their permissions.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address any emerging vulnerabilities.
